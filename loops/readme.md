LOOPS!

There are two types of loops that we will go over. 

FOR and WHILE

Python is meant to be a very 'literal interpreted' language so think of the actual meanings of the words in the following lessons.


1. lets start with the idea of indexing. Open indexing.py
2. Lets head to for_loop_example.py
3. Once youre comfortable we can move on to while loops

While loops
while loops are mixed with conditionals
so the loop will only execute its instructions while the condition is true
