# HOW TO RUN A SCRIPT

to run a script you will type the word 'py' to say I would like to use this python environment
and then the name of the script (if you are in that directory).

pwd = Print Working Directory. 'YOU ARE HERE'
for example if you type 'pwd' into your terminal it may print out 
'/Users/me/python-lessons/conditions'

ls = list files. 'What is in the 'file cabinet (directory) you are currently in'

so running 'ls' may return 'age_example_quiz.py     conditional_example.py'

This means that inside your working directory(pwd) there are two files(ls)

so to execute the script you would call the python environment and the name of the script.

This works since you are in the directory
# py conditional_example.py

if you were outside the directory you could still call it by using the full file path
# py /Users/me/python-lessons/conditions/conditional_example.py
