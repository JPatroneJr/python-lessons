Comments-
The quotes surrounding this denote a multi-line comment in this case.
#A single line comment will have a pound sign in front of it like this one.

Any commented block/line WILL NOT be executed. so you can type anything here.
Mostly notes, keep it clean folks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables-
Variables are just like you remember in algebra, they can be set to anything 
and will change the formula/operation they are used in 

x = 1
1 + x = 2

x = 4
1 + x = 5

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variable Types-
For now we will stick with the basics.
String (str)
Integer (int)
Float(float)
Boolean Value (bool)  --- True or False
'''



var1 = 'x'
var2 = 1
var3 = '1'
var4 = 1.1
var5 = True

# this is the 'operation' with its variable
# change the variables out of the ones above or make new ones and see what comes out
# if you get an error dont worry!

print(f'The variable is {var1}')
print(f'The variables type is {type(var1)}')
